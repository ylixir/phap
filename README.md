This project aims to build a simple, easy, and lightweight parser library.

Parsers written with this tool should be exceptionally easy to read and modify.

Currently I am still exploring the best API for these needs. Expect breaking changes while we travel down the road to 1.0.

In the meantime, you can get an idea of where we stand by perusing the waffle board linked above.

# Contributions

Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Feel free to open pull requests, issues, start a conversation on an issue, etc.

We provide a dedicated development environment to make it easy to get started.

# Travis builds

We use Travis-CI to enforce automated quality control and to manage deployments of new versions.

There is a page I can't find from the travis ui.
You can diagnose failed travis builds from [here](https://www.travis-ci.com/ylixir/phap/requests).
